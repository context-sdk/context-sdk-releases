ContextSDK is a powerful tool that brings real-world context and insights directly into your app through on-device signals, empowering you to boost conversions and engagement, enhance user experiences, and reduce churn â€” all with privacy in mind, as no personally identifiable information (PII) is ever collected.

Our SDK is written 100% in Swift and fully supports Objective-C, making it easy to integrate into both Swift and mixed-language projects.

## Getting Started

This repository is dedicated to managing releases of ContextSDK for Swift, distributed as a **Swift Package** with pre-built `.xcframework` binaries. For other platforms, such as Flutter and Android, or alternative installation methods like CocoaPods, please see our [official documentation](https://docs.decision.contextsdk.com/).

To integrate ContextSDK into your Swift project, add the repository as a Swift Package Manager (SPM) dependency:

1. In Xcode, go to <kbd>File</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Add Packagesâ€¦</kbd>
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/context-sdk/context-sdk-releases`
3. Choose the latest version tag.

Or, add the SPM directly to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(name: "ContextSDK", url: "https://github.com/context-sdk/context-sdk-releases", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.7.0")),
]
```
